    "description": "Another of the most photographed temples in Cambodia, Ta Prohm is recognized by its labyrinth pattern of roots that cover the structures. It actually may seem to you like an octopus is holding on to something dear to it. According to a Sanskrit stone sculpture, the details of its authorities were once portrayed in the walls of the temples. As you amble through the premises, you\u2019ll witness how nature has dominated man made remnants; but this blend is something that makes Ta Prohm stand out.\r\n\r\nLocation: Angkor Archaeological Park, Krong Siem Reap, Cambodia\r\nTimings: 5AM-6PM",
